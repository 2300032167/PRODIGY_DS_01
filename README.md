Task-01: Visualizing Data Distribution with Bar Chart or Histogram
This task involves creating a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical (e.g., gender, occupation) or continuous (e.g., age, income) variable. The goal is to represent how frequently different values occur within the dataset, making it easier to identify patterns, outliers, and trends.

Key steps include:

Importing and cleaning the dataset.

Selecting an appropriate variable for analysis.

Choosing the right type of plot (bar chart for categorical, histogram for continuous).

Visualizing the distribution using Python libraries like matplotlib or seaborn.

This kind of visualization is fundamental in data analysis and helps in understanding the underlying structure of the data before applying any complex modeling or statistical techniques.
